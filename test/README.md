The test directory contains our test suite using standard python unit tests. <br />
To run the tests, execute the python file in terminal using the filepath that it is located in. <br />
###### Example:
```
python ~/test/testcalculator.py
```
Our tests currently handle the **multiplication**, **division**, **addition**, and **subtraction** functions.
